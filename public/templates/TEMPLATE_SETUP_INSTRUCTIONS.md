# Template Setup Instructions

Your Word template document (`journal_template.docx`) needs to have placeholders that will be replaced with the actual data. Here's how to set it up:

## Required Placeholders

Open your `journal_template.docx` file in Microsoft Word and add the following placeholders where you want the data to appear. Make sure your header image is already positioned exactly how you want it.

### Student Information Section
Add a table or formatted text with these placeholders:

```
Student Name: {fullName}
Student Registration Number: {rollNumber}
Class & Section: {classAndSection}
Study Level: {studyLevel}
Year & Term: {yearAndTerm}
Subject Name: {subjectName}
Name of Assessment: {assessmentName}
Date of Submission: {submissionDate}
```

### Reflective Journal Content Section
Add another section with these placeholders:

```
Topic: {topic}

Experience: {experience}

Feelings: {feelings}

Learning: {learning}

Application:
{application}

Conclusion: {conclusion}
```

## Important Notes

1. **Curly braces are required**: Each placeholder must be wrapped in curly braces like `{fullName}`
2. **Exact spelling**: The placeholder names must match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. **Header stays intact**: Your header image and any formatting you've applied will remain unchanged
4. **Formatting**: You can apply any formatting (bold, colors, fonts, etc.) to the text around the placeholders, and it will be preserved
